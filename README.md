## Selenium

From time to time you have to update the Chrome driver as older versions are not supported any more by Google Chrome.
Do this by updating the NuGet dependency version. 

## Testing

1. Use the testsettings.changeme.json in the DataDownloader.Test project.
1. Rename it to testsettings.json and fill the settings with the according values.
1. Please make sure to not commit this file afterwards as it contains a KeePass password.
    * Best practice is to use a KeePass file not containing anything apart from the entries necessary.
    * Use a generated master password for this KeePass database.
